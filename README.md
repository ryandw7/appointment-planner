# CodeCademy React Appointment Planner

## Project Goals:

In this project, you will use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.

You will work with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks. The requirements section will walk through implementing the app from the topmost component down. If you would like to implement it in a different order, feel free to do what is comfortable for you.

### Step 1

The application code starts with App.js, ContactsPage.js, and AppointmentsPage.js. These are the three stateful components you will work with in this project. App.js is located in the /src directory in the file explorer and should already be open in the code editor.

App is a stateful component that handles the routing between the two pages, ContactsPage and AppointmentsPage. This is already implemented using React Router.

Note: You do not need to be familiar with React Router to complete this project.

Based on the given requirements, implement App as a stateful component that maintains appointments and contacts. It should also pass those values, along with callback functions to update those state values, to its child components.

App Requirements:

Keep track of the contacts and appointments data, each being an array of objects

Define a callback function that, given a name, phone number, and email, adds a new contact object with that data to the array of contacts

Define a callback function that, given a name, contact, date, and time, adds a new appointment object with that data to the array of appointments

Pass the array of contacts and the appropriate callback function as props to the ContactsPage component

Pass the appointments array, contacts array, and the add appointment function as props to the AppointmentsPage component

### Step 2

ContactsPage.js is located in the /src/containers/contactsPage directory in the file explorer and should already be open in the code editor.

Based on the given requirements, implement ContactsPage as a stateful component to handle the logic for adding new contacts and listing current contacts.

ContactsPage Requirements:

Receive two props:
The current list of contacts
A callback function for adding a new contact

Keep track of three local state values: the current name, phone, and email entered into the form

Check for duplicates whenever the name in the form changes and indicate the name is a duplicate

Only add a new contact on form submission if it does not duplicate an existing contact’s name

A successful submission should clear the form

In the Add Contact section, render a ContactForm with the following passed via props:
local state variables
local state variable setter functions
handleSubmit callback function

In the Contacts section, render a TileList with the contact array passed via props

### Step 3
ContactForm.js is located in the /src/components/contactForm directory in the file explorer and should already be open in the code editor.

Based on the given requirements, implement ContactForm as a stateless component that renders a web form to collect the necessary contact information.

ContactForm Requirements:

Render a form with:
The onSubmit attribute set
3 controlled <input> elements, one for each piece of contact data
A submit button

Include a pattern attribute to the phone <input> with a regex that matches the phone locale of your preference

### Step 4
Open the TileList.js file located in the /src/components/tileList directory.

Based on the given requirements, implement TileList as a stateless component that renders a list of Tile components using an array of objects.

TileList Requirements:

Receive one prop:
An array of objects to render as a list

Use the array passed via props to iteratively render Tile components, using each object in the array to pass the name and description props to each rendered Tile component

The requirements for the TileList component are generalized and allow it to be shared by the ContactsPage and AppointmentsPage components. As long as an array of objects with either the contact data or appointments data is passed then the content will be handled appropriately.

### Step 5
Open the Tile.js file located in the /src/components/tile directory.

Based on the given requirements, implement Tile as a stateless component that renders the data from an object.

Tile Requirements:

Receive two props:
name
description

Render a <p> element with the name prop. Give this element a className of "tile-title"

Iterate over the values in the description object, passed in via props, and render a <p> element for each value and give each a className of "tile".

Just like the TileList component, the Tile component is generalized to work with data from any object. This allows it to be used in both the ContactsPage and AppointmentsPage components.

### Step 6

Open the AppointmentsPage.js file located in the /src/containers/appointmentsPage directory.

Based on the given requirements, implement AppointmentsPage as a stateful component that handles the logic for adding new appointments and listing current appointments.

AppointmentsPage Requirements:

Receive three props:
The current list of appointments
The current list of contacts
A callback function for adding a new appointment
Keep track of four local state variables, the current name, contact, date, and time entered into the form
Add a new appointment on form submission
Clear the form on submission
In the Add Appointment section, render an AppointmentForm with the following passed via props:
local state variables
local state variable setter functions
handleSubmit callback function
In the Appointments section, render a TileList with the appointment array passed via props

### Step 7

Open the AppointmentForm.js file located in the /src/components/appointmentForm directory.

Based on the given requirements, implement AppointmentForm as a stateless component that renders a web form to collect the necessary appointment information.

AppointmentForm Requirements:

Render a form with:
The onSubmit attribute set to the callback function passed in via props
3 controlled input components, to be used for the name, date and time appointment data
A ContactPicker component with the contacts list passed in via props
A submit button

Use getTodayString() to set the min attribute of the date input

### Step 8

Open the ContactPicker.js file located in the /src/components/contactPicker directory.

Based on the given requirements, implement ContactPicker as a stateless component that renders a drop-down list of all contact names.

ContactPicker Requirements:

Receive 4 props:
The array of contacts
A callback function to handle when the onChange event is triggered
value
name

Render a select element with the onChange attribute set to the callback passed in via props, a value attribute set to the value prop, and a name attribute set to the name prop.

Add a default option element with the text “No Contact Selected” and a value attribute of "".

Iteratively add option elements using the contact names from the array passed in via props
